# ALU-
As part of my deep dive into chip design workshop, and with guidance from the IEEE Student Branch, I recently worked on creating an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU is a crucial component of any processor, responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations.
Implementing key operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR
Optimizing for performance and power efficiency, aligned with IEEE standards.
